# tlvdemux

`tlvdemux` is a C++17, standard-library-only incremental demultiplexer for
already-descrambled ARIB MMT/TLV streams. It is designed to emit player-ready
HEVC, AAC-LATM/LOAS and ARIB STD-B62 TTML access units without converting the
stream to MPEG-TS or exposing FFmpeg ABI types.

The current implementation provides the stable public callback API, bounded
incremental TLV resynchronization, compressed-IP context isolation, MMTP
fragment/aggregation handling, PA/M2/MPT track discovery, descriptor-driven
timelines, and HEVC/AAC-LATM/TTML access-unit output.

## Build and test

```sh
nix-shell
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

No runtime dependency other than the C++ standard library is required.

Shared-library builds are enabled by default. Linux produces
`libtlvdemux.so.0` (with the versioned implementation file), while macOS
produces the corresponding `libtlvdemux.0.dylib`. Use
`-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF` when a static `libtlvdemux.a` is preferred.
The exported interface is a C++17 ABI, so dynamically linked consumers should
use a compatible compiler and C++ standard library.

When embedding the project with `add_subdirectory()`, the diagnostic executable
can be disabled with `-DTLVDEMUX_BUILD_TOOLS=OFF`. Tests follow CMake's standard
`BUILD_TESTING` option.

Install the library, public headers and CMake target export with:

```sh
cmake --install build --prefix /desired/prefix
```

The install includes the shared or static library, public headers, the
`tlvdemux::tlvdemux` CMake package target, the diagnostic tool when enabled,
and the MIT license.

## Library usage

Implement `tlvdemux::Sink`, keep it alive for the lifetime of the demuxer, and
feed arbitrary-sized chunks synchronously:

```cpp
#include <tlvdemux/demuxer.hpp>

class PlayerSink final : public tlvdemux::Sink {
public:
    void onService(const tlvdemux::ServiceInfo& service) override;
    void onTrack(const tlvdemux::TrackInfo& track) override;
    void onAccessUnit(tlvdemux::AccessUnit&& unit) override;
    void onError(const tlvdemux::Error& error) override;
};

PlayerSink sink;
tlvdemux::Demuxer demuxer(sink);
demuxer.push(data, size);
demuxer.flush();
```

`push()` does not retain the input pointer. Callback payloads own their data,
and malformed stream data is reported through `onError()` while parsing
continues where recovery is possible. Call `reset()` when replacing the input
stream; service and track selection policies are retained.

Audio tracks expose their MH audio component metadata through
`TrackInfo::audio`, including the signalled channel layout, component type,
main-component flag and sampling rate. Select tracks from this metadata rather
than assuming packet IDs remain fixed between programmes.

## Inspect a stream

```sh
./build/tlvdemux-inspect --list test.tlv
./build/tlvdemux-inspect --trace-au test.tlv
./build/tlvdemux-inspect --video video.hevc --audio audio.loas \
  --subtitle subtitle.ttml test.tlv
./build/tlvdemux-inspect --audio secondary.loas \
  --audio-packet-id 0xf311 test.tlv
```

Use Mirakurun's raw 4K path with `decode=0` when capturing validation input:

```sh
curl 'http://MIRAKURUN/api/services/SERVICE_ID/stream?decode=0' > test.tlv
```

When more than one track of a kind is present, the diagnostic dumper writes the
first discovered supported track of that kind. `--trace-au` still reports every
emitted track.

The library assumes any required B61 descrambling has already happened before
the bytes reach `Demuxer::push()`. In the validation setup, Mirakurun
`decode=0` preserves the MMT/TLV stream while the tuner/frontend path supplies
already-usable media payloads. B61 message-authentication metadata is parsed so
an appended authentication code is not exposed as part of the media payload;
cryptographic verification itself remains the caller's responsibility.

## Current scope

Version 0.1 supports the ARIB broadcast subset exercised by the validation
streams: all four HCfB compressed-IP modes (`0x20`, `0x21`, `0x60`, `0x61`),
MMTP signalling and fragmented media, HEVC Annex B, AAC-LATM/LOAS, and ARIB
STD-B62 TTML. CAS/descrambling,
TTML rendering, EPG/application assets, seeking, indexing, and general-purpose
ISO MMT are outside the library's current scope.
